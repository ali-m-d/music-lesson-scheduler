                I believe that, no matter your goal, learning an instrument should primarily be great fun. 
                Whether you want to pass grades, play in a band as a hobby or even become a professional musician, 
                my main aim is to ensure you enjoy yourself. I teach all ages and abilities, and offer consultations with 
                no obligation for future lessons - contact me for a chat and weâ€™ll take it from there!

                I obtained my BMus (Hons) Saxophone from Guildhall School of Music & Drama in 2012, 
                and alongside saxophone my studies included high-level tuition in flute, clarinet and piano. 
                Whilst undertaking my studies, I began teaching woodwind and piano lessons, which I have continued to do ever since.
